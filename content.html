            <li>Programming has grammar just like english. There are correct and incorrect ways of saying things</li>

            Assigning a variable is as simple as declaring example = 9 or more complicated as example2= 1 + 3 858 - 351</li>

            <li>Assigning the value of the right side to the left
            Variables can be useful when you need to store a value that will be referenced multiple times or will be changing throughout a program</li>

            <li>Variables can be numbers and strings
            Numbers and strings are two different data types and generally cannot be used in equations</li>

            <li>You must create a function to use it. When making it, it requires you name it with def, give the function parameters it will operate on later, and code to run the parameter against</li>

            <li>When using a function you generally have to pass it the required arguments that it then executes against its code block</li>

            <li>Functions can be called repeatedly so you can implement it in multiple spots throughout a larger project. This makes it so you are able to more flexibly reuse the same code over and over</li>

            <li>You must always have a return statement otherwise nothing will happen with your function</li>

        <ul>

            <li>OOB is a programming paradigm and not a programming language. Programming languages can be OOB programming languages</li>
            <li>OOB programming is commonly used in many projects large and small because of the modularity, dynamism, and reusability of code written in a OOB manner</li>
            <li>When programming in an OOB you will be able to reuse function(methods) that are defined in a class so you can reuse blocks of code to repeat the same thing but for different objects</li>
            <li>It is advantageous to program with an OOB model so you don't have to repeat things similarly to how you don't have to repeat CSS by having it in a separate file that your HTML can reference as many time as you need that styling.</li>

        </div>
         <ul>

            <li>Object: An object is a model of what can be done within a class. The object can be a variable, function, and/or data.</li>
            <li>Class: A Class is expandable code for creating objects</li>
            <li>Instance: An instance is a specific implementation of a class. In the same way that you have a fish being a class, salmon is a class, and a salmon named mary is an instance.</li>
            <li>Method: A Method is a procedure/function that is inside of a class</li>
            <li>Module: A Module is a file that you import to your program to then access it's contents for methods and classes.</li>
            <li>Library: A library is a repository of prebuilt classes and functions that will help you with tasks that are oriented around the library.</li>
            <li>Class Variable: A class variable is a variable defined in side of a class that many different instances of the class can take advantage of.</li>
            <li>Variable Inheritance: Variable inheritance is where a variable is defined in a parent class but is being used by a child class inheriting it. That variable doesn't then need to be defined in the same manner as it is in the parent class</li>
            <li>Method Overriding: This is a feature that allows a child class to have its method be method be utilized instead of parent method that has already been written.</li>

            <li>Templates are useful to separate html from logic</li>
            <li>Using templates will allow greater reusability and maintainability of html. This is can be done by havin
                g html you would use in multiple pages in a template that can be utilized on separate pages without rewr
                iting that hmtl content there.  </li>
            <li>Templating also allows for variables. With variables in a template you can have a value that can change
                on the backend and then be fed through to the template at the time of rendering. This will allow for gre
                ater use of non static content. </li>

        </div>

        <ul>

            <li>I chose to learn more about JavaScript as currently that is where I see my future path leading me. I currently
                work as a Software Quality Analyst and learning more about JavaScript and JQuery will empower me
                to do front end automated testing. </li>
            <li>Completing all of the project at <a href ="https://dash.generalassemb.ly/projects"> https://dash.
                generalassemb.ly/projects</a>. The take aways I got from this in regards to JavaScript is it is used for
                dynamic changes on a page and using Jquery in conjunction empowers you to create pages that can react to
                events that occur.</li>
            <li>An example of a jQuery statement is "$('p').css(''color, 'blue');". In this example the $ is an alias for
                the jQuery function and it is selecting the 'p' element. It is then modifying the css because of the '
                .css'. Then the parameters for '.css' specify 'color' and 'blue' for the 'p' css element. </li>
            <li> Some additional resources I referred to are <a href ="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/About_JavaScript">https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/About_JavaScript</a> and <a
                    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript</a></li>
            <li>I used those previous links for information about the history and implementations of JavaScript. JavaScript
                is an object oriented language like python. Variables do need to be defined in JS but you don't give
                variables a type you assign type to values. There are many other things that make JS unique but these are
            just a couple things that stood out to me.</li>
